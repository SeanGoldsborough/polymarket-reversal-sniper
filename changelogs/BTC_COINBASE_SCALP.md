# BTC-COINBASE-SCALP Changelog
**File:** `btc_coinbase_scalp.py`
**Strategy:** Scalp Polymarket tokens on Coinbase BTC price signals (>$5 move in 1s)
**Status:** Paper testing (Phase 1)

## 2026-05-05
- Initial creation
- CB websocket monitors BTC/USD for >$5 moves in 1 second
- GTC maker limit buy on corresponding side (0% fee)
- GTC maker TP sell at entry + $0.04 (0% fee)
- Websocket SL monitoring at entry - $0.03 (FAK taker sell)
- Sequential: one trade at a time
- 4s fill timeout, cancel if unfilled
- Entry bounds: $0.15 - $0.85
- No trades after T+280, force exit at T+295
- Realistic paper simulation:
  - 125ms latency on every operation
  - Book depth from websocket determines fills
  - Ask-side depth for buy fills, bid-side depth for TP sells
  - Price re-checked after latency delay (slippage)
  - Taker fee simulated on SL/force-exit sells
  - Partial fill detection and tracking
